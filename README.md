I made this app in response to a challenge posted on the Developer Launchpad website: [http://developerlaunchpad.com/2019/06/07/chords/]

17-06-2019 - I added the ability to choose minor chords.  This required a major rewrite, as the minor root names are slightly different to the major root names.

## Technologies used:
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
